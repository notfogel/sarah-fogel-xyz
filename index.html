<p class="body">I just finished graduate school, getting my MA in Geography at the University of Kentucky. I am seeking employment opportunities in library and academic settings in the Chicago area.</p>
<p class="body">I am an upbeat, curious, fiercely detail-oriented team player with a passion for learning, helping others, and cycling. Originally from the area, I am incredibly excited to return to Chicagoland to bring my enthusiastic attitude and wide-ranging knowledge to your workplace!</p>
<p class="body">Please feel free to reach out to me with any inquiries at sarah@sarahfogel.xyz - thanks for visiting!</p>
